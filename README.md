The execution of the program starts from run.py and run2.py

In run.py, please use 'ktype' to set different algorithms. 'sadc' is the method proposed in this study; 'normal' means that the model training does not use the gradient optimization algorithms; 'cagrad' and 'pcgrad' are two optimization algorithms respectively.

In run2.py, please use 'ktype' to set different algorithms. 'sgd-influence', 'd-shapely' and 'cl' are three sample quality based methods.
